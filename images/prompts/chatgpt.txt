ChatGPT said:
Hey! That sounds like a sweet project (literally üçãü•≠). Let‚Äôs get that prompt locked in so I can help you generate exactly what you need. I‚Äôll ask you a few quick questions to shape the prompt properly:

ü•≠ Website for Selling Mangoes ‚Äì Questions:
Name/Brand: Do you have a name or logo for your mango-selling business?

Target Audience: Who are you selling to? (e.g., local customers, nationwide delivery, international?)

Product Info: Are you selling one type of mango or multiple varieties? Any other products?

Content:

Do you want sections like Home, Shop, About Us, Contact, etc.?

Will you take orders directly via the site (like a cart), or redirect to WhatsApp/phone for orders?

Design Style: Do you want a simple, clean look, or something colorful and tropical?

Photos: Do you have mango/product images, or should we use placeholders for now?

Payment: Will you integrate a payment gateway (like Razorpay, Stripe), or handle payments offline?

Domain Name: Will you be using a custom domain (like mymangoes.com) or the default GitHub Pages URL?

Any inspirations: Any websites you like that you'd want this one to look/feel like?

Once you give me the answers, I‚Äôll turn that into a clean prompt for generating your site code and content. Let‚Äôs build your mango empire üçÉüíº
